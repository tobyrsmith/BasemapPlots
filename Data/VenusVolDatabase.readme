Data organization

The Magellan Volcano Catalog in the following pages lists the locations
of individual volcanic and magmatic features to the nearest 0.5 degrees,
together with dimensions, brief descriptions or comments, existing
names, and an "MVC (Magellan Volcanic feature Catalog) Number"
consisting of the latitude, longitude, and short abbreviation for the
feature type. These are arranged by feature type in alphabetical
ordering, starting with north latitudes and prime meridian for each
feature.

Feature Terminology. The feature type designations used here are
informal. Some terms imply a geologic origin and other terms are
non-genetic. The level of geological detail available from Magellan
image data are such that many of the centers may be assigned with
reasonable certainty to a broad class of relatively well-known geologic
phenomena, such as volcanoes or calderas, and the need for generally
non-genetic terminology is diminished. Further more detailed division of
feature types is generally more non-genetic. For these and other reasons
discussed below, informal terms used early in the Magellan mission, such
as "anemone", have been replaced in our catalog with more descriptive
terms such as "radially-patterned intermediate volcano".
In general several non-genetic terms for many large scale features
originated during the analysis of Venera 15/16 image data because the
resolution was such that the geologic origin of many large scale
structures, such as coronae or arachnoids, was indeterminate. Similar
informal terms were used early in the Magellan mission for many types of
newly-identified morphological features. An attempt was made with some
preliminary terms used by the Magellan team, to use Latin derivative
terms, as was done successfully with tesserae earlier. Informal usage of
Latin in addition to informal and colloquial terms in general impeded
this approach and resulted in errors. For example, the term "nova" arose
from the astronomical term for an exploding star, even though its
original Latin sense ("new") has nothing to do with a stellate pattern.
These and other problems are of the type that are sorted out with usage,
but should be noted and avoided. Currently the term "corona" seems to be
accepted, "arachnoid" is not favored but may have been in use long
enough to continue, but the terms "nova" and "tick" are generally
considered inappropriate and in need of replacement. Simple terms that
readily characterize a feature are most convenient, and as a rule
non-whimsical terms are more appropriate.

Locations/Catalog Accuracy. The data in this catalog were compiled by
two people jointly verifying each identification, classification, and
numerical entry and acting as a check of the other's observations. A
second verification of locations was performed subsequent to completion
of the catalog by three people. Every effort was thus made during
compilation and editing to check and re-check the accuracy of
identifications, locations, dimensions, and tabulation. In addition to
providing a continual check of individual accuracy, the tandem survey
also controlled excessive "drifts" in identification and interpretation
criteria that often occur in efforts of this type requiring observations
over an extended period by a single individual. However, as with any
carefully assembled, large geophysical data set of this size and
complexity, a certain low percentage (generally Â²5%) of transcription
and related "mechanical" errors occurs can occur [for example, see
discussion of Pacific intraplate seismicity map in Lay, 1991, EOS, 72,
page 468 or Wysession et al., 1991]. Users might be alert for the few
obvious errors. Commonly identified and corrected errors during the
review process included latitudinal errors resulting from inversion of
north or south (e.g., 15 degrees instead of -15 degrees), corresponding
mis-interpolation from latitudinal scale label points (e.g., -20 degrees
mis-read as 20 degrees and a feature 2 degrees north of that identified
as being at 22 degrees instead of -18 degrees), multiplicative
longitudinal shifts (e.g., 290 degrees instead of 190 degrees, or 180
degrees instead of 190 degrees), incorrect MVC numbers, and
typographical errors in feature descriptions. Instances of these types
of errors are few, but these examples are offered as keys to recovering
the data from the most likely occurrences of errors of this type.

Another advantage that has resulted from limiting the initial survey
analysis to two individuals has been an increased ability to reach
agreements about definitions, identifications, and related problems
during the actual survey. Although, the disadvantage of this approach
might be that a wide range of individual interpretations and
perspectives are not presented within the catalog, the advantage is that
the Magellan Volcanic Feature Catalog is assembled with extreme
attention to consistency. This consistency together with the descriptive
comments for each feature should enable alternative definitions or
divisions to be readily accommodated if desired.

Dimensions. All dimensions are diameters, unless otherwise noted, and
are approximate. Lava channel dimensions represent the length of
channels. The diameters of large volcanoes are measured to the distal
edges of the radial lava flows of median length. Diameters of coronae
and arachnoids represent the mean diameter of the most prominent
concentric ring. The diameter of radial fracture centers or stellate
patterns is the diameter defined by using the median fracture length;
fractures which are continuations of longer rift or fracture belt trends
are not considered in arriving at the value for the median length.

MVC#. Few features on Venus are named as yet. Consequently, for purposes
of brief identification, we have assigned a Magellan Volcano Catalog
number ("MVC#") to each feature. The MVC # is simply an abbreviated
description of the latitude, longitude, and volcanic feature type for
each entry.

C1-MIDR.#s Preliminary list of C1-MIDRs in which the feature appears.
F-MIDR #s Preliminary list of F-MIDRs in which the feature appears.
Entered Comments. All comments identify salient characteristics relevant
to the location of individual features with respect to adjacent
features, apparent radar characteristics ("bright" or "dark"), and any
other information deemed pertinent to establishing unique or unusual
properties of the feature(s) listed. Feature Names. Names assigned to
individual features included in the catalog are those approved by the
International Astronomical Union as of the time of this writing. In
general, the only systematic attempt to assign names has been for
craters and coronae. With the exception of two or three well-known and
frequently used names such as Eve Corona and Heng-O Corona, preliminary
names or suggested names which are not on the official IAU Venus
nomenclature list are included in parentheses. In some cases the
co-ordinates listed in the IAU list for a feature may differ from those
judged from Magellan data as representing the center of a particular
volcanic feature. IAU names for which no corresponding volcanic feature
is identified have not been included. Where the co-ordinates of our list
and the IAU list differ significantly, the assumed corresponding feature
name is listed with a query ("?") symbol. Many existing IAU-named
features have no apparent Magellan volcano counterpart.

Identification of feature types is here based largely on volcanic
criteria and infrequently corresponds to a single IAU physiographic term
(e.g., "patera" often includes arachnoids, calderas, and large
volcanoes). We note also that we have found few features on Venus which
correspond to the official definition of patera as originally described;
the usage of this term as a type of elevated relief feature, in
particular, a low volcanic shield or edifice as exemplified on Mars and
previously applied on Venus, does not correspond to the original IAU
definition which identifies it as a flat-floor, irregular-margined
depression. Other classifications. Due to variations in assumed defining
characteristics and differences in interpretation, many individual
features may be assigned to different feature types by different
authors. This column list other classifications that have been assigned
to the same feature by other authors.

Abbreviations: The following abbreviations are used in the catalog
headings. Words in quotation marks note the equivalent informal
terminology used in early science reports.

AR = Arachnoid                        IV/SSD = Steep-Sided Dome
("pancake")
CO = Corona                           LC = Lava Channel
FF = Festoon Flow                     LF = Lava Flow, Lava Field
IV = Intermediate Volcano             LV = Large Volcano
   (unspecified)
IV/FD= Fluted Dome (scalloped dome;   SFC = Stellate Fracture Center
   "tick")                               ("nova")
IV/RP = Radially-Pattern volcano      SF = small Shield volcano Field

Supplementary table notes: A query symbol ("?") denotes some difficulty
or uncertainty in classification due to characteristics of a particular
feature which are unusual or gradational to another feature type. A
number following a feature designation [for example IV/SD(4)], means
that there are multiple features of this type occurring close together
(within 0.5 degrees lat/long ).
